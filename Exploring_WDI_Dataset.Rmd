title: "Exploring WDI Dataset"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

We need to import the `fpp2` package.

```{r}
library('fpp2');
```

We also need to set the *working directory*.

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/home/hendra/Datasets/WDI_Indonesia')
```

We show the current *working directory*.
```{r}
getwd()
```

Let us _read_ the WDI CSV file.  
```{r}
WDI.df <- read.csv("completed_values_1962_2013_design_matrix.csv", header = TRUE)
```

#### BEGIN MWE
  
```{r}
typeof( c(1, 2, 3)  )
```
  
```{r}
temp <- c(1,2,3)
```

```{r}
temp[1]
```

  
  
```{r}
typeof(WDI.df[2])
```
  
  
  
#### END MWE

We turn one of the indicators into a `ts`.
```{r}
y <- ts() 
```
